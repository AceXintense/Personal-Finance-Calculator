# Personal Finance Calculator 
A beautifully simple finance calculator to work out your outgoings in a daily, weekly, monthly, yearly format.
Simply add you're yearly income and the application will calculate the values on the fly.

## Why use this over different tools?
I designed this application to help with my personal financing. I have tried many different applications to handle my 
'personal financing' situation and all of them seem to forget one main element
direct debits / monthly fixed outgoings.

## Features
* Live value calculation
* Difference calculation
* Unlimited card creation
* Yearly, Monthly, Weekly, Daily calculations
